# CLI Window System
>**This is a linux app only**

The purpose of this git is to provide an example of a C++ program that will, while using the console, create a way to have different windows of information.

To run download clone the repo or download to a directory.  In said directory type the following command.

```bash
make
```

once this has completed with zero errors type this in the prompt.

```bash
./prog.run
```
You should see three windows open in the console and be able to move about them.
